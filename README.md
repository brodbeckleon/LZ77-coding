# LZ77 Compression and Decompression

This repository contains Python scripts implementing the LZ77 compression and decompression algorithms, optimized for MicroPython environments like the TI-nspire calculator series. Both `.py` and `.tns` versions of the scripts are included.

## lz77_compress.py and lz77_compress.tns

`lz77_compress.py` compresses text data using the LZ77 algorithm. The corresponding `.tns` file can be directly imported into TI-nspire calculators.

## lz77_decompress.py and lz77_decompress.tns

`lz77_decompress.py` decompresses data compressed by LZ77. The `.tns` file is also available for direct import into TI-nspire calculators.

### Usage

Input your text data into `lz77_compress.py` or `.tns` to compress it, and use `lz77_decompress.py` or `.tns` to decompress LZ77 compressed data.

### MicroPython Compatibility

Designed for MicroPython, suitable for devices like the TI-nspire calculator series.
